I started working in [Computational Imaging Group] (https://compimag.org) at UMC Utrecht as a PhD student since October, 2018. I am working on MR-STAT project under the supervision of Prof. Nico van den Berg and Dr. Alessandro Sbrizzi. MR-STAT is a new framework for fast, multi-parametric quantitative MR imaging. During my PhD, I work on both developing new MR sequences and improving the model-based reconstruction algorithms.  

I have a mixed background in Biomedical engineering and Applied mathematics. I am interested in various image reconstrution problems. Before working in MR field, I worked on developing Computed Tomography reconstruction algorithms at Neusoft Medical Corporation.
